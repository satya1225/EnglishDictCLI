# EnglishDictCLI
A Python CL implementation of english dictionary

This program takes the Command line input, a word or phrase from user, connects to a remote MS SQL database, and fetches the meaning of the word or phrase.

The program is smart enough to suggest an alternate word if there is no matching word in the database.
